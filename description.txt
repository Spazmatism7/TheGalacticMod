The Galactic Mod is a small content mod I've been working on for a while. It aims to add content where we feel the game needs more. This mod's goal is to flesh out underwhelming parts of the 
game. We also aim to improve the Terraria experience, and make each experience a fresh one.

There are over 300 new items for you to explore; including weapons, accessories, armors, tools, vanity and new blocks.

The Galactic Mod adds;
 - 7 new potions
 - 25 new accessories
 - 4 new crafting stations
 - 15 new armor sets with unique set bonuses
 - 4 new pets
 - 14 new enemies
 - 5 new Bosses
 - 2 new Gamemodes (Blood Mode and No Hit)
 - An expanded throwing class (several new armors and weapons)

I have been working on this mod for a little while now. I hope you all enjoy it.
I couldn't have done it without my loyal development team. They are all wonderful people and deserve credit.

The Team:
Spazmatism7: Lead Developer, Programmer, Sprite Artist
Noodles56: Sprite Artist (On Leave)
Schparksss: Sprite Artist

The following people aren't devs, but did help in some way. They also deserve a round of applause.

Special Thanks:
Cherry_Chan: Ex Sprite Artist
noah_B: For the base of the Hellfire Dragon code (Former Dev)
Bry: Some of the Galactic Peril sprites
Scarecloud: Ex Sprite Artist
